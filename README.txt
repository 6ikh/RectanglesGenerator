The program will start and you will be prompted to enter the number of rectangles (n). Type in the desired number of rectangles and press Enter. 
The program will generate random rectangles and check for overlaps. If any rectangles overlap, the program will regenerate them to ensure there is no overlap. 
After generating valid rectangles, the program will write the rectangle data to a text file named "rectangles.txt" in the same directory as the program.
Then it will display the message: "Rectangle data written to 'rectangles.txt'" if the file is successfully written. After that it will calculate and display the total occlusion angle over all rectangles in degrees. Using the data written to the 'rectangles.txt', the user can run the grapher.py to look at all the points of the rectangles on a graph.
